<h3>How to submit a code review</h3>

<ul>
<li>You will be assigned two students to peer review shortly after you complete your own initial submission.</li>
<li>For each student, which you are assigned, you will do the following:

<ul>
<li>Locate their submissions and download all of the patches in the patchset (besides the cover letter).</li>
<li>Make a new branch off of master/main and switch over to that branch to apply the patches.</li>
<li>Make sure each patch applies cleanly IN ORDER (a.k.a no corrupt patches, whitespace errors, etc.)

<ul>
<li>You can run checkpatch.pl on the patches, ignore any errors pertaining to maintainers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure the code compiles without warnings or errors.</li>
<li>Make sure the program runs without crashing.</li>
<li>Make sure that the output is correct (passes all tests, if applicable).</li>
<li>If there are any problems with the submission, document said issues and report them in your email reply to the student who you are reviewing.</li>
<li>If you determine that there are no issues with the submission, inform the recipient.

<ul>
<li>If it turns out that there were issues with the submission that you missed, points will be deducted from your overall assignment grade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refer <a href="course_policies.html">here</a> for the grading policy regarding peer reviewing.</li>
</ul>
