<h3 id="final">Final ðŸ”š</h3>
<p>You will be assigned a branch to checkout and a diff.</p>
<p>Your task is to apply the patch and get the new code to compile (there may be a few errors to fix), describe what the patch does and why the patch should be accepted upstream. Imagine you were trying to convince a maintainer to accept your patch.</p>
<p>Generate a properly formatted email patch, add a title and blurb to the body as per tradition, and then email it to us.</p>
<p>You will do a 10 minute presentation on this assignment and the previous and it will be worth 30% of your final grade ðŸ˜³.</p>
<p>Your presentation will discuss how you debugged the driver, how you found the errors, what your various thoughts were at different stages leading up to your conclusion, and what tools you used. Save screenshots of interesting errors or stages of the process to use in your presentation. You should have slides to present and you may use live code examples straight from your source if you wish. After you finish your presentation, we will interrogate you :)</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<p>What to submit: This time, forget about the cover letter. Your presentation will contain more than enough exposition of your thoughts and sentiments towards this assignment. Simply send us a corrected version of the original patch with an appropriate commit message discussing what issues you found and why your patch fixes them and is a good patch that should be applied to a public tree. This simulates the Linux kernel patch submission process.</p>
