<h3 id="mid1">Mid1 - Specification üìê</h3>
<p>Write a specification and userspace test program for a character device</p>
<p>You should come up with a simple but interesting and non-trivial character device that does something entertaining.</p>
<p>The test program should exercise the followinf system calls:</p>
<p>- read</p>
<p>- write</p>
<p>- ioctl/unlocked_ioctl</p>
<p>- llseek/lseek</p>
<p>- open</p>
<p>- close/release</p>
<br></br>
<p>What to submit:</p>
<p>- A patch to the assignment directory containing your directory named firstname_lastname.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;- The first patch should create this directory and add a Makefile to build your test program.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;- Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least -Wall but ideally -Wextra -Wpedantic or even -Weverything if you use clang) and that your code doesn‚Äôt have any warnings or errors.</p>
<p>- The second patch should add your test program.</p>
<p>- The third patch should add your spec.</p>
<p>- Don‚Äôt forget a cover letter.</p>
