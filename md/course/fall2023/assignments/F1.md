## F1 - Teamwork ü§ù

You will recieve one of your collegue's specification and tests created per
[F0](F0.md);

You must implement the character device from spec as a Linux kernel module.

Your collegue's tests should pass when run against your implementation.


If you have a problem with the spec or tests you are given,
communicate with its author to work out
suspected bugs,
potential areas of ambiguity,
or even design errors.
You can even suggest new features
to better align the final product with the original creative vision.

If the spec author is uncooperative,
let us know and we can help


**FIXME do we want this?**
We encourage you to have your discussions about each other‚Äôs code
as responses to the patch emails from the previous assignment.

You will deliver a final presentation on both parts of this assignment.

### Outcomes

* Validate your practical knowledge of character devices
* Gain experience doing multi-programmer software engineering
* Practice discernment between ones own bugs and those of a teammate
* Utilize the cumulative knowledge one has gained in the course
* Simulate the open source development process


### What to submit:

* A patch which adds a directory named `firstname_lastname` to the F0 folder of the class repo containing the original specification.
* A patch which adds the original test program and makefile.
* A patch which adds your character driver and modifies the original makefile to build it.

	* Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least `-Wall` but ideally `-Wextra -Wpedantic` or even `-Weverything` if you use clang) and that your code doesn't have any warnings or errors.
* Don‚Äôt forget your cover letter.

* Submit your patches to `final1@kdlp.underground.software`

### Procedure:

**TODO**

0. Implement the character driver from spec using the
[miscdevice](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.5/driver-api/misc_devices.html) API.
0. Build and load the driver. Build and run the tests.
