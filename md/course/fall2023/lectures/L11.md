# Lecture 11 - 14 October 2023

## Topics Covered:
* Student questions on P1
* /proc filesystem
* Midpoint presentation discussion
* E2 and promised videos

## /proc filesystem
* Called this as shorthand short for process contains info about running processes
* Functionality overlaps with /sys (sysfs filesystem)
* sysfs vs procfs - proc is the old one, it is more or less without rules and structure and at some point it was decided that proc was a little too chaotic and a new way was needed.Then sysfs was created, and the new stuff that was added was put into sysfs like device information. So in some sense they do the same, but sysfs is a little bit more structured
* We discussed mount proc, not procfs but referred to as proc filesystem. Since it is a filesystem that is mounted, no real backing device only existing in RAM
* tmpfs used as another example of RAM-only fses
* initramfs vs initrd - [Whatâ€™s the Difference Between initrd and initramfs? | Baeldung on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/initrd-vs-initramfs#:~:text=Differences%20Between%20initrd%20and%20initramfs,%2C%20simplicity%2C%20and%20memory%20efficiency)
* We showed a demo of include/linux/init.h and fs/proc/cmdline.c using the compressed kernel config as an example


## Race Conditions
A common issue in multithreaded applications where two operations compete to be executed at the same time. They show up in numerous forms, including in software, storage, memory, and networking.
