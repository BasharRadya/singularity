<h3 id="a-spectre-is-haunting-the-linux-kernel">A SPECTRE IS HAUNTING THE LINUX KERNEL…</h3>
<h6 id="the-spectre-of-time">…The spectre of time!</h6>
<p>Throughout the industry, we have observed a shortage of qualified entry-level software engineers focused on the low-level niche, and especially within the sub-niche of the Linux kernel. As young, novice software engineers, we noticed this problem, and we quickly became aware that we were far from the only ones to do so. Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed – both privately and publicly – that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently. We have seen firsthand among the many talented and experienced engineers firsthand and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever. Time spares no one, not even the engineers from the days of Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>
<p>We have come to understand the invaluable and non-quantifiable nature of the tribal knowledge that exists distributed among the great engineers of our industry, and we believe that we must act quickly to enable them to pass on the torch, to strengthen the next link of the great chain of our relatively young but quickly maturing industry.</p>
<p>With this understanding, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.</p>
