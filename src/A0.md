### A0 - Git comfortable ðŸ¥²

Welcome to the class! Please introduce yourself and learn how to submit email patches :)

#### Outcomes:
* Get familiar with git and git patches.
* Get familiar with how to submit to the mailing list (`git send-email`).
* Get familiar with the peer review process, which we will use for the rest of the course.

#### Procedure:
* Add a file to the `A0/` directory within the [class repository](https://github.com/underground-software/KDLP_fall2022) named `first_last.md`, where first and last are your first name and last name respectively (e.g. `joel_savitz.md`), containing an introduction about yourself. The content can be whatever you want, whether it be why you are taking this class, your favorite ice cream flavor, or some random fact about yourself.
* Make a commit out of your changes.

#### What to submit:
* Generate a patchset from your commit and cover letter.
* Send the patchset to the mailing list.
