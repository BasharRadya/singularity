### TL;DR:

The Kernel Development Learning Pipeline (KDLP) program aims to create a comprehensive Linux kernel talent pipeline to address the current shortage of qualified entry level kernel candidates. 

### The What 

Kernel Development Learning Pipeline (KDLP) is a program composed of two primary aspects.


**The first** is a program to develop a comprehensive Linux kernel education, mentoring, onboarding, and a talent development pipeline.

**The second** is an open source initiative to improve Fedora Linux on the Raspberry Pi.


With our team of associates, interns and mentors, we are:

* Developing an individually-driven kernel engineering skills training program and talent pipeline.
* Broadening the accessibility of the Linux kernel engineering space to include people from backgrounds where they otherwise would not be exposed.
* Giving students a relatively unique (for academia) hands-on software engineering experience that they otherwise would not get without first obtaining an internship.
* Improving Fedora Linux usability, stability, and performance on the Raspberry Pi, a platform on which Fedora's status quo demands engineering attention.
* Producing up to date open source Linux kernel education materials and content to go along with Red Hatâ€™s open source software, solving the common problem of stale documentation.
* Providing opportunities for public speaking and mentorship for engineers at any level of experience, from interns leading class sessions to Distinguished Engineers adding unique wisdom to any and all content.

The virtual and distributed nature of our program empowers us to include students from a diverse range of backgrounds. Not only can we offer this program to college students, we can include ambitious and advanced high school students, self-studying engineers, and determined career-switchers. We provide the rigorous standards, mentorship, and hardware, and the students bring their grit, intensity, and determination to succeed.
