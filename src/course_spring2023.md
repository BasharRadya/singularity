### Spring 2023 Course

#### Course Summary and Purpose

We aim to introduce students to the concepts, tools, and framework necessary for independent work on the Linux kernel.

#### Course description

Linux is the most widely used operating system in the world. The core software component of the Linux operating system is the kernel. A couple of its roles include managing hardware interactions, virtualizing system resources, and enforcing security constraints. In effect, Linux kernel powers almost all of the worldâ€™s top supercomputers, android phones, and an innumerable variety of other computers. This course will introduce students to Linux kernel development by focusing on device driver development. This will give students hands-on experience working with internal Linux kernel APIs and provide an overview of some of the core features and components of the kernel. Gaining an understanding of the inner workings of the operating system and how to make changes to it will give students an invaluable perspective on how their computers work behind the scenes that will reveal a new layer of understanding to apply to any future software engineering practice.


#### Course objectives

Students will:

* Stretch their C programing skills to the limit

* Create, develop, and test interesting and creative Linux kernel modules

* Develop the ability to autonomously participate in the open source software community

* Learn how to give and recieve feedback on code patches

* Demonstrate the ability to explain your code and your knowledge of Linux in your own words

#### Required Materials

1. A Linux environment to which you have root access and ideally physical access.

2. Patience, determination, and an ability to focus on a frustrating task for sustained periods of time.
