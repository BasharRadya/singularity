<h3 id="assignment4">A4 - Building Character 1 ðŸ’ª</h3>
<p>Get familiar with the system calls you can make on a character device by writing a userspace program to interact with the character driver from class.</p>
<p>There is a twist however. You will apply a patch to the driver code from class so that it logs a sequence number associated with each operation.</p>
<p>You will be assigned a random sequence of operations and you must write a userspace program that performs the operations in the correct order to get a matching output in dmesg.</p>
<p>Your program should check for system call errors.</p>
<p>Submit your userspace program and the logs from dmesg for a successful run along with your assignment writeup.</p>
<br></br>
<p>What to submit:</p>
<p>- A patch to the assignment directory containing a directory named firstname_lastname.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;- The first patch should create this directory and add your Makefile</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;- Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least -Wall but ideally -Wextra -Wpedantic or even -Weverything if you use clang) and that your code doesnâ€™t have any warnings or errors.</p>
<p>- The second patch should add your userspace program that implements the assignment.</p>
<p>- The third patch should add a file containing the output in dmesg from the driver upon a successful run of your program</p>
<p>- It is not necessary to submit the patched driver.</p>
<p>- Don't forget the cover letter</p>
