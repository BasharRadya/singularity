<h3>TL;DR:</h3>

<p>The Kernel Development Learning Pipeline (KDLP) program aims to create a comprehensive Linux kernel talent pipeline to address the current shortage of qualified entry level kernel candidates.</p>

<h3>The What</h3>

<p>Kernel Development Learning Pipeline (KDLP) is a program composed of two primary aspects.</p>

<p><strong>The first</strong> is a program to develop a comprehensive Linux kernel education, mentoring, onboarding, and a talent development pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>The second</strong> is an open source initiative to improve Fedora Linux on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>With our team of associates, interns and mentors, we are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developing an individually-driven kernel engineering skills training program and talent pipeline.</li>
<li>Broadening the accessibility of the Linux kernel engineering space to include people from backgrounds where they otherwise would not be exposed.</li>
<li>Giving students a relatively unique (for academia) hands-on software engineering experience that they otherwise would not get without first obtaining an internship.</li>
<li>Improving Fedora Linux usability, stability, and performance on the Raspberry Pi, a platform on which Fedora&rsquo;s status quo demands engineering attention.</li>
<li>Producing up to date open source Linux kernel education materials and content to go along with Red Hatâ€™s open source software, solving the common problem of stale documentation.</li>
<li>Providing opportunities for public speaking and mentorship for engineers at any level of experience, from interns leading class sessions to Distinguished Engineers adding unique wisdom to any and all content.</li>
</ul>


<p>The virtual and distributed nature of our program empowers us to include students from a diverse range of backgrounds. Not only can we offer this program to college students, we can include ambitious and advanced high school students, self-studying engineers, and determined career-switchers. We provide the rigorous standards, mentorship, and hardware, and the students bring their grit, intensity, and determination to succeed.</p>
