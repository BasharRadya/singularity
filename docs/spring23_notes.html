<p>Notes on first class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do this right now: https://kdlp.underground.software/course_application.html

<ul>
<li>To get in discord server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Online Syllabus: https://kdlp.underground.software/course_spring2023.html</li>
<li>This is not like other classes!!!

<ul>
<li>The course attempts to encapsulate the ethos of open source development in a classroom environment</li>
<li>Introduce the tools, techniques and etiquette of submitting code to the kernel and provide practice with them</li>
<li>Practical C coding, and plenty of it!</li>
<li>Practical research</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means:

<ul>
<li>Public submissions</li>
<li>Peer review</li>
<li>Emphasis on presenting your work and explaining the process vs just getting the right answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why should you care? Why is the grind worth it?

<ul>
<li>This class will let you practice key skills for your career in a lower stakes environment:

<ul>
<li>Practice communication skills that are absolutely invaluable in the tech industry</li>
<li>Wisdom from people who already have careers in CS</li>
<li>Experience with C programming on a large codebase</li>
<li>Experience with git and other linux utilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And, if you are considering a career in kernel development:

<ul>
<li>Instructors are the real deal</li>
<li>Guest lectures from senior developers at Red Hat</li>
<li>Linux Foundation Certificate</li>
<li>Familiar with kernel code base / functions</li>
<li>Familiar with mailing list workflow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requirements to be able to complete the class successfully (do, or have done this by add drop or you should drop the class):

<ul>
<li>A Linux environment that you have root access to

<ul>
<li>The following are not adequate:

<ul>
<li>The UML CS servers (you do not have root access)</li>
<li>WSL (need to be able to compile custom kernel)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recommended:

<ul>
<li>Run Linux in a virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible, but not recommended:

<ul>
<li>Dual boot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideal, but expensive (donâ€™t go buying hardware for this class)

<ul>
<li>Second machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even if you use linux as a daily driver, you might still consider a VM or dual booting to protect your main install (e.g. from downtime or data loss in case you mess something up since we are working on the kernel)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setup VM ASAP!

<ul>
<li>If you are on Windows or an intel (x64) mac use Virtual box</li>
<li>If you are on linux, use QEMU</li>
<li>If you are on an M1 (aarch64) mac use UTM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We recommend installing Fedora Linux since it is a fully open source distro that upstream pretty closely

<ul>
<li>Download the iso file for the right architecture (x86_64 for windows and intel mac, aarch64 for M1 mac)</li>
<li>Setup vm with appropriate amount of resources</li>
<li>Ensure you can connect to it using ssh from your host machine</li>
<li>Shut it down and set it to headless mode (no window). Start and stop as needed for your course work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go over course policies: https://kdlp.underground.software/course_policies.html</li>
<li>Introductory assignments

<ul>
<li>Fill out the form on the website. A(-1), due end of day today!</li>
<li>Git and git patches. A0, due tomorrow!</li>
<li>Setting up git send email, A0</li>
<li>Shell. A1 due 11:59pm Jan 29</li>
<li>Compiling kernel. A2 due 11:59pm Jan 29</li>
<li>We will provide as much help and guidance as we can

<ul>
<li>The lectures until Jan 30 will be reserved for questions about the assignments. If there are no questions, we will proceed with the scheduled lecture material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you canâ€™t handle the heat, get out of the kitchenâ€¦</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In conclusion

<ul>
<li>This class is relatively frontloaded!</li>
<li>If you can make it past A2, you will probably be fine.</li>
<li>NO EXAMS! ðŸ˜€</li>
