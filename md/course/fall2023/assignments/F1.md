## F1 - Contributing to Open Source Software ü§ù

You will receive a specification and tests created per
[F0](F0.md)
by one of your colleagues.

You must implement the character device from spec as a Linux kernel module.

Your colleague's tests should pass when run against your implementation.

### Outcomes

* Simulate the open source development process
* Put your knowledge of character devices into practice
* Demonstrate your reading comprehension of technical topics
* Simulate teamwork and communication aspects of working on a real-world coding team
* Work with imperfect information and discern between your own errors and those of others

* Practice discernment between ones own bugs and those of a teammate (COME BACK???)
* Utilize the cumulative knowledge one has gained in the course


### What to submit:

* A patch which adds a directory named `firstname_lastname` to the F0 folder of the class repo containing the original specification.
* A patch which adds the original test program and makefile.
* A patch which adds your character driver and modifies the original makefile to build it.

	* Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least `-Wall` but ideally `-Wextra -Wpedantic` or even `-Weverything` if you use clang) and that your code doesn't have any warnings or errors.
* Don‚Äôt forget your cover letter.

* Submit your patches to `final1@kdlp.underground.software`

### Procedure:

**TODO**

0. Implement the character driver from spec using the
[miscdevice](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.5/driver-api/misc_devices.html) API.
0. Build and load the driver. Build and run the tests.

**THE BIN**

If you encounter any issues such as
suspected bugs,
potential areas of ambiguity,
or possible design errors in anything you are given,
you will 

communicate with the author to work out

If the spec author is uncooperative,
let us know and we can help


**FIXME do we want this?**
We encourage you to have your discussions about each other‚Äôs code
as responses to the patch emails from the previous assignment.
