<h3>A3 - Hello kernel üêß</h3>

<p>Write a kernel module that prints a message to the kernel ring buffer when the module is inserted and initialized and when the module is removed and exits.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that messages sent to the kernel ring buffer with printk (or its macro variants in the pr_* family) will not be shown in dmesg until a newline is sent or printk is called a second time. For that reason, we recommend using printk directly in this assignment and, of course, ending your format string with the ‚Äò\n‚Äô newline escape character.</p>

<p>There are numerous examples online, including one in the slides that we showed in class. Feel free to start from any of these.</p>

<p>The string ‚Äúhello world‚Äù is acceptable but boring. If you can make us laugh at your patch we will honor you in front of your peers.</p>

<p>Your submission must include the output of dmesg that is generated upon inserting and removing your module.</p>

<p><br></br></p>

<p>What to submit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first patch should create a directory in A3/ titled firstname_lastname and add your Makefile.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least -Wall but ideally -Wextra -Wpedantic or even -Weverything if you use clang) and that your code doesn‚Äôt have any warnings or errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Within the firsname_lastname/ directory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Feel free to name files, other than the Makefile, as you please.</p></li>
<li><p>The second patch should add your .c file containing the module code.</p></li>
<li><p>The third patch should contain the output of dmesg.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to include a cover letter as an additional patch</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
