### A4 - Building Character 1 ðŸ’ª

Get familiar with the system calls you can make on a character device by writing a userspace program to interact with the character driver from class.

There is a twist however. You will apply a patch to the driver code from class so that it logs a sequence number associated with each operation.

You will be assigned a random sequence of operations and you must write a userspace program that performs the operations in the correct order to get a matching output in dmesg.

Your program should check for system call errors.

Submit your userspace program and the logs from dmesg for a successful run along with your assignment writeup.

<br></br>

What to submit:

- A patch to the assignment directory containing a directory named firstname_lastname.

  - The first patch should create this directory and add your Makefile

  - Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least -Wall but ideally -Wextra -Wpedantic or even -Weverything if you use clang) and that your code doesnâ€™t have any warnings or errors.

- The second patch should add your userspace program that implements the assignment.

- The third patch should add a file containing the output in dmesg from the driver upon a successful run of your program

- It is not necessary to submit the patched driver.

- Don't forget the cover letter
