<p>Content:</p>
<p>What have you learned so far by doing the assignments?</p>
<p>- How did the assignments relate to what we learned in class in your own words</p>
<p>What challenges have you faced and overcome working on these tasks?</p>
<p>- Your assignment write ups should be useful here</p>
<p>Assignments you think you did an exceptional job on</p>
<p>- Why do you think so? Maybe demonstrate your competence/understanding</p>
<p>What assignments did you enjoy or not enjoy and any feedback</p>
<br></br>

<p>Suggestions on what to prepare:</p>
<p>- Visual demonstrations if you think they are helpful</p>
<p>Live example of how your project functions</p>
<p>- Could do something in the terminal live</p>
<p>Maybe show your program‚Äôs inner workings</p>
<p>- Explain your thought process</p>
<br></br>
<p>The presentation should demonstrate that you understand your work, you are able to explain what you did and why it matters to others, and you are able to show your thought process when you are faced with a problem.</p>
<p>An example of a previous presentation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_Rnp7VD-SzqRZvgsm-oBlL87ry6dLVc/view">here</a>.</p>
<p>These are general guidelines for what we are looking for in a presentation. You do not need to follow it strictly but you should try to cover all of the areas at least somewhat.</p>
