<h3>A5 - Building Character ðŸ’ª</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;t time to write your first driver!</p>

<h4>Outcomes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get familiar with which system calls can be performed on a character device file.</li>
<li>Get familiar with how the behavior of a character device is specified by its <code>file_operations</code> in the driver.</li>
<li>Get familiar with how userspace code can invoke kernel code.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<ul>
<li>You will be assigned a random sequence of operations.</li>
<li>Add the <code>ioctl</code> and <code>llseek</code> syscalls to your copy of the driver provided in the <a href="https://github.com/underground-software/KDLP_assignments">assignment repo</a>.

<ul>
<li>Your implementations should be based on the implementations of the read and write operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write a userspace program to interact with the character driver from class.

<ul>
<li>The userspace program will call the syscalls available through the driver in order of the sequence assigned to you. The userspace program should produce a matching output to what is assigned to you.</li>
<li>Your program should check for system call errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>What to submit:</h4>

<ul>
<li>A patch which adds a directory named <code>firstname_lastname/</code> to the assignment repo containing a copy of the provided driver and Makefile.</li>
<li>The second patch should add the <code>ioctl</code> and <code>llseek</code> operations to the existing driver.</li>
<li>The third patch should add your userspace program that implements the assignment and should add to the existing Makefile.

<ul>
<li>Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least <code>-Wall</code> but ideally <code>-Wextra</code> and <code>-Wpedantic</code> too, or even <code>-Weverything</code> if you use clang) and that your code doesnâ€™t have any warnings or errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fourth patch should add a file containing the dmesg log from the driver upon a successful run of your program.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget the cover letter.</li>
</ul>
